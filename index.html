    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    The <b>chicken</b>(Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated form of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus),
    originally native to Southeast Asia. It was first domesticated around 8,000 years ago and is one of the most common
    and widespread domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are primarily kept for their meat and eggs, though they
    are also kept as pets.[1]
    <p>
        As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, with more than 50 billion birds produced
        annually for consumption. Specialized breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed for meat and
        egg production, respectively. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. Chickens are social
        animals with complex vocalizations and behaviors, and feature in folklore, religion, and literature across many
        societies. Their economic importance makes them a central component of global animal husbandry.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds,
        and the wings are short.[20] Wild junglefowl can fly, whereas domestic chickens and their flight muscles are too
        heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[21] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[20]
        Newly hatched chicks of both modern and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties
        however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb)
        of a heritage chicken of the same age.[22]</p>
